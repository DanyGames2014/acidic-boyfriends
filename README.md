# Acidic Boyfriends

A mod for Minecraft b1.7.3 made with StationAPI (requested by UncleAcid).

Boyfriends:
- Spawn randomly in your world
- Can be tamed just by clicking them (temporary?)
- Once tamed, they will follow their owner and can be sat down
- You can heal a tamed boyfriend by clicking on him with food
  - If it doesn't bring them to max health, they will emit smoke particles
  - If it does bring them to max health, they will emit heart particles
